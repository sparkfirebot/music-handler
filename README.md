# Sparkfirebot's music handler

This is extremely basic, I plan on updating it a lot more in the future with other sources other then youtube, but this is it for now.

I wouldn't recommend trying to use this on your own bot, it's designed for the older versions of APIs and might not work. The code here's intended use is for looking at, learning how it works and improving your services if you **need** it.
